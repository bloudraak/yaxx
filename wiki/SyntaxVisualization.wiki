This page is under construction on how to visualize the output of YACC/YAXX.

* Grammar Visualization
Yacc Grammar can be visualized through graphviz by the 
following project [http://www.lo-res.org/~aaron/yaccviso/ YaccViso].
A more general idea is to visualize the grammar as a program by itself
using the program syntax visualization accompanied with yaxx, as the
yacc grammar is also an instance of the a meta-grammar :-)
Similarly we can construct grammar visualization not just for yacc, but
also for other grammar-generators.

* Program Syntax Visualization 
The YAXX parse tree can be visualized by the related ParserTree project, e.g. PHP.
