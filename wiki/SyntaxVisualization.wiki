* Grammar Visualization

YACC Grammar can be visualized through graphviz by the 
following project [http://www.lo-res.org/~aaron/yaccviso/ YaccViso].

A more general idea is to visualize the grammar as a program using our program syntax
visualization with yaxx, as a YACC grammar is also an instance of the a meta-grammar
(grammar of the grammar, see bison's implementation) :-)

Similarly we can construct grammar visualization not just for YACC grammars, but
also for other parser-generators's grammars.

* Program Syntax Visualization 

The YAXX parse tree can be visualized by the related phpParseTree project, e.g. PHP.

William, can you link here to your description on how you visualized the php parse tree ?
