* Grammar Visualization

YACC Grammar can be visualized through graphviz by the 
following project [http://www.lo-res.org/~aaron/yaccviso/ YaccViso].

A more general idea is to visualize the grammar as a program using our program syntax
visualization with yaxx, as a YACC grammar is also an instance of the a meta-grammar
(grammar of the grammar, see bison's implementation) :-)

Similarly we can construct grammar visualization not just for YACC grammars, but
also for other parser-generators's grammars.

* Program Syntax Visualization
